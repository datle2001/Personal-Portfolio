      I'm a junior and currently pursuing Computer Science major and Math minor at DePauw University. I am highly intersted in cross-platform products and would love to work as a web, software, and/or mobile developer. My skills so far include Java, C++, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and React. Nodejs will hopefully make the list by the end of this year.
